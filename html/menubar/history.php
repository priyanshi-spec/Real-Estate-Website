    <h1>Our Company History</h1>

    <p>
        Founded in 1998, House & Life began as a small, family-inspired venture with a simple mission:
        to redefine the way people experience real estate. What started as a two-person operation in a 
        modest office on the outskirts of Brookdale City has grown into one of the region’s most trusted 
        and innovative property development companies.
    </p>

    <div class="year-title">1998 — The Beginning</div>
    <p>
        In the early years, House & Life specialized in small residential projects, helping first-time 
        homebuyers find reliable and affordable housing. With dedication and quality craftsmanship, our 
        reputation grew quickly.
    </p>

    <div class="year-title">2005 — First Milestone</div>
    <p>
        By 2005, the company completed its first landmark project, “Brookdale Heights,” a major housing 
        complex that elevated living standards for the city and solidified our position in the industry.
    </p>

    <div class="year-title">2008 – 2015 — Modernization Era</div>
    <p>
        As the market evolved, we embraced innovation—integrating smart home features, eco-friendly 
        materials, and energy-efficient designs. During this period, we expanded into commercial real 
        estate, launching our first mixed-use development.
    </p>

    <div class="year-title">2018 — A Growing Family</div>
    <p>
        By 2018, House & Life had grown to a team of over 100 dedicated professionals. Together, we 
        shaped neighborhoods and transformed communities with luxury residences and commercial hubs.
    </p>

    <div class="year-title">Today — A Legacy of Excellence</div>
    <p>
        Today, with over 75 completed projects, House & Life continues to build spaces that inspire,
        empower, and uplift lives. Our story is one of passion, innovation, and unwavering commitment
        to the communities we serve.
